<h2><strong>T</strong>he Minimalists</h2><p>I´m a minimalist. I decided to consume mindfully a long while ago and there are two people that inspired me to do so. Jushua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus from “The Minimalists”. You should follow their blog <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/" title="TheMinimalists">www.theminimalists.com</a> if you feel like your life could use more freedom, more time and less distraction in general.<strong>T</strong>he Documentary</p><p>Today I finally got see their documentary on what they and other people see as one of the biggest problems in our modern societies: compulsive consumption. In their 90 minute piece they make the case for more mindfulness in the way we consume during, organize and share our lifetime with others around us. I have been deeply humbled and inspired by their movie. If you can´t afford the 20 USD to get it online, simply invite yourself to my place, bring some hummus and carrots and we´re gonna watch it together. I believe the guys would approve of this being a way to socialize.</p><h2><strong>T</strong>he Letter</h2><p>So after watching the documentary I had to write the guys a little thank you note and what started as a three lined note developed into this piece about how they had had a positive impact on my life and what had changed for me since I first became aware of the movement that is minimalism.</p><p><strong>You can read the full text here:</strong></p><p><em>Thank you guys! Thank you so much for your wonderful movie. This goes out to all the people involved. Director, Editor, Operators, hands at your book tour, your parents, your families, your friends, your doubters and supporters likewise.</em></p><p><em>For the last three years or so I have been following your website. The Minimalists (you guys) have become a constant stream of inspiration and change for my life.</em></p><p><em>I have grown up with a single mom and my sister. When she remarried we moved into a much bigger home than before and even though stuff was more accessible at the time my mom always encouraged us to use what we had and not to want for unnecessary things in our lives as children. She supported us with everything that we needed. Of course she bought us treats at the store when we had be good and she didn´t when we had not deserved it. Somehow her set of values spilled over into mine and now being a 31 year old, an officer in the military and looking at the end of a 12 years contract I feel like she has given me everything I ever needed to become a success.</em></p><p><em>Being successful and what it meant for my core family (my mom, my sister and my older brother (rip)) was never about financial wealth or the job that you worked. I always felt like success was about how well we acted on what we really wanted from life. As a young boy I didn´t understand what that meant, nor did I really have the words or concepts to express what I was being exposed to. But I knew from early on that my mom was doing a lot of things differently than other families and that it felt good to know she´ll always have my back - whatever I do.</em></p><p><em>Today I watched your documentary and after waiting for a while for it to come to Vimeo I was so excited to finally see it. Yes, excited. Like I had been excited about sales or the new iPhone or whatever and before I put my credit card information into Vimeo´s purchase system I asked myself: Is watching this bringing value to my life?” And I realized that it already had. That your website, your blogposts, the short videos and the longer pieces I had seen about you really had had their effect, their impact on my life.</em></p><p><em>It started when I was working at a military training facility in the dead center of Germany. So far away from any friends and working so long that working out and watching documentaries was literally the only thing to hold me back from drinking or loosing it in other ways. I probably watched all the sports-documentaries, all the music-documentaries, all the other stuff until I had nothing else to watch but movies on environmentalism and politics. All of that got me interested in TED and other sources of alternatives ways to connect to people´s thoughts on life and what it really was all about. One day, browsing the web - totally into tiny houses and design I came across <a href="http://lifeedited.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifeedited.com</a> and shortly after found my way to your blog.</em></p><p><em>I found your story and your way of presenting it so compelling that it got me thinking really hard. The good thing was that I really didn’t have to go back to a clutter less life, I simply had to stop turning into a compulsive consumer. I was clearly on a path towards that. Filling the emptiness of my existence in the military with stuff. In many cases they were things that had some values to my life. But it wouldn’t be too long before moving or my fleeting interest for things would make me want more. The longing for “new” or “different” was real and I had fallen for it.</em></p><p><em>So I set out to declutter and I did. They were only a few things I really needed to get rid of. With the true excess gone I felt much more in control of what I thought my life was. But I quickly realized I had to change more than just the number of shirts, shoes and guitar cables I was owning. I started to declutter my personal life. Broke up with the relationship that hadn’t been working for either of us. We disconnected and either one felt more freedom and we actually made the transition to staying friends happen. I called my dad and talked to him about all the emotional stuff that had accumulated over the years of non-communication, of calling for the holidays and birthdays and thats it. It felt like I had finally gained enough maturity to stand up to the idea of his judgement for who I was and who I wasn’t. For what I wanted and my feeling that he never really cared for what that was. For all the moments I had felt judged or left on the outside. Or simply for not feeling loved by him like a real dad. I had felt used and betrayed and I finally had the guts to tell him.</em></p><p><em>You guys reminded me of some of the most immanent values in how my mom had raised me. She just never had put them into words in such a way that they would look great on Instagram or a poster on someone´s wall.</em></p><p><em>You helped me to remember how much freedom I felt when in the first three years of my officers training course I had lived out of two military duffle bags, one personal bag and a small car traveling from course to course all across Germany. I was neck deep in the shit of life and hungry to learn. I didn’t sleep much. I shared a tiny room with four other guys and my privacy was the size of a shoebox with a lock on it. I was reduced to the control I had over my sheer body and the ability to say yes to somethings but not much to say no to in my professional life. I was alive, I was making mistakes and I enjoyed that so much more than being a miserable platoon leader and trainier and the armed forces training center for Afghanistan.</em></p><p><em>After speaking up about my direct superior that had mistreated me on numerous occasions and the help of a very understanding lieutenant colonel and his boss (a colonel) I got to change careers inside the military. After training for leadership in the mountain infantry division and a failed attempt to becoming a helicopter piloted, a much hated but nevertheless well graded masters in politics and sociology, I got to become one of the very few video journalists that the military has. I finally got to see what I always wanted to understand. The bigger picture of how the military organizes itself. I got to travel to foreign deployments, to training missions in numerous countries and I got to experience the vastly and wildly different realities of people´s lives in- and outside of the military across the globe. I call this a very satisfying carrier and lifestyle worth living.</em></p><p><em>I´m not saying that my state of happiness is a direct effect to reading your blog or giving away some excess shirts. All I´m saying is that I fucking love you guys for what you did for me. But believing in your path, by blogging about it, by writing your books and making this amazing film.</em></p><p><em>Today I´m writing you because I have been deeply effected by the stories you´ve shared in this documentary. I´ve had the plan to talk more about minimalism and you the minimalists to the people that follow me. I´ve had bagged an even bigger pile of clothing than the first one I had gotten rid of and I wanted to sell it. But I realized that used-clothing is essentially worthless in our society, even when its really good quality. At least for men that´s the case here in Germany.</em></p><p><em>Watching your documentary reminded me of a couple of things I wanted to do with those things and some due change to how I lived. I have a much clearer picture of the different ways that minimalism can help me reshape my lifestyle and how I can have a more profound effect on the people around me.</em></p><p><em>This letter is probably the longest piece I have written in a long while. I wanted to take Joshua´s writing course and I think I will soon. Thank you for the inspiration and reflection it provided to write down how I felt about your documentary.</em></p><p><em>Thank you.</em></p><p><em>P.S.: If you guys ever need a place to stay in Berlin you are welcome to crash in my 29sqm apartment. One bed, one foldable desk, some foldable chairs to seat friends, some gymalsticrings on the selling and a tiny kitchenette. Its enough and I´m happy to share.</em></p><p><em>Hug, Chris</em></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="42"><!-- react-empty: 43 --></div></section><section id="3" class="Section
