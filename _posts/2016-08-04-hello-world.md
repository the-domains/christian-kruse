# Hello World

This classic line has been a great deal of inspiration to me. "Hello World." To me its symbolizing the infinite possibilities of not only the world of technology, servers or social media. Its an expression of purpose, self-awareness and change that is such a strong force in our human lifes.

Its our parents who are the first to await our arrival and we answered with all we know how to express ourselves at the moment of birth. A crying sounds that from that moment one will serve as the ultimate beacon in a world full of love, tragedy and searching.

We are all on a search. I am searching for words to express how I feel about this very moment. This is my state of being. I live inside moments as much as possible. It helps me to express what I feel, what I want from life and makes me realize that appreciation and work are the foundations of all change.

I´m excited to that you chose to share this moment with me! Thank you!

* Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "Hello, World!" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972\.
